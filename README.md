## üöÄ News

- **[5/16/2025]** üöÄ We're excited to announce the release of our new paper and the initial public availability of its corresponding code.


## üí° Introduction
We introduce **TREESYNTH**, a tree-guided subspace-based data synthesis approach inspired by decision trees. It constructs a spatial partitioning tree to recursively divide a task-specific full data space (i.e., root node) into numerous atomic subspaces (i.e., leaf nodes) with mutually exclusive and exhaustive attributes to ensure both distinctiveness and comprehensiveness before synthesizing samples within each atomic subspace.

</div>
This globally dividing-and-synthesizing method finally collects subspace samples into a comprehensive dataset, effectively circumventing repetition and space collapse to ensure the diversity of large-scale data synthesis.

## ‚ö° Quick Start

### üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
<!-- - Required dependencies (see `requirements.txt`) -->
- API access to OpenAI/Azure or local model deployment via vLLM

### üì• Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cpa2001/TreeSynth.git
cd TreeSynth
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Backend Setup

TreeSynth supports three backend configurations. Edit `config.py` to configure your preferred backend:

**Option A: OpenAI API**
```python
BACKEND_CONFIGS = {
    "openai": {
        "api_key": "your-openai-api-key",
        "model_name": "gpt-4o",
    }
}
```

**Option B: Azure OpenAI**
```python
BACKEND_CONFIGS = {
    "azure": {
        "api_key": "your-azure-api-key",
        "model_name": "gpt-4o",
        "azure_endpoint": "https://your-endpoint.openai.azure.com/",
        "api_version": "2024-10-21",
    }
}
```

**Option C: vLLM (Local Deployment)**
```python
BACKEND_CONFIGS = {
    "vllm": {
        "api_base": "http://localhost:8000/v1",
        "api_key": "your-vllm-api-key",
        "model_name": "/path/to/model/qwen2_5-72b-instruct",
    }
}
```

For vLLM deployment, use the provided script:
```bash
bash vllm.sh
```

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Tree Generation Parameters

Configure the core TreeSynth parameters in `DEFAULT_CONFIG`:

```python
DEFAULT_CONFIG = {
    "max_depth": 4,                          # Maximum tree depth
    "num_samples_per_node": 10,              # Samples generated per node
    "max_attribute_count": 50,               # Maximum attributes per node
    "max_sample_infinite_attribute": 50,     # Threshold for infinite attributes
    "infinite_path_samples": 10,             # Samples for infinite paths
    "max_workers": 64,                       # Concurrent workers
    "max_concurrent_requests": 64,           # Concurrent API requests
    "max_retries": 5,                        # Maximum retry attempts
}
```

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ API Pool Configuration (Optional)

For high-throughput synthesis, configure multiple API endpoints:

```python
# Multiple Azure endpoints for load balancing
OPENAI_API_POOL = [
    {
        "endpoint": "https://endpoint1.openai.azure.com/",
        "key": "azure-api-key1",
        "version": "2024-10-21",
        "model": "gpt-4o",
    },
    {
        "endpoint": "https://endpoint2.openai.azure.com/",
        "key": "azure-api-key2",
        "version": "2024-10-21",
        "model": "gpt-4o",
    }
]
```

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running TreeSynth

Execute the data generation pipeline:

```bash
# Generate tree structure and synthesize data
python main.py --backend openai --task_type math
```

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Example Usage

```python
from treesynth import TreeSynth

# Initialize TreeSynth with configuration
synthesizer = TreeSynth(
    backend="openai",           # or "azure", "vllm"
    max_depth=4,
    num_samples_per_node=10,
    task_type="math"
)

# Generate diverse dataset
dataset = synthesizer.generate_dataset()
print(f"Generated {len(dataset)} diverse samples")
```

### üß© Advanced Configuration

For custom task domains, modify the task-specific prompts and templates:

```python
# Custom task configuration
CUSTOM_TASK_CONFIG = {
    "task_name": "custom_domain",
    "root_description": "Your domain description",
    "attribute_types": ["type1", "type2", "type3"],
    "sample_template": "Your sample generation template"
}
```



## üó∫Ô∏è Overview of TreeSynth
TreeSynth consists of two key stages: data space partitioning and subspace data synthesis.

During the former phase, TreeSynth employs a spatial partitioning tree to recursively divide a task-specific whole data space (i.e., root node defined by textual descriptions) into numerous atomic subspaces (i.e., leaf nodes). These subspaces are characterized by mutually exclusive and exhaustive attribute values to ensure both distinctiveness and diversity.

In the subsequent subspace data synthesis phase, samples are generated within each subspace separately, before collecting them as a diverse and comprehensive dataset. By employing this globally divide-and-synthesize methodology, TreeSynth effectively prevents repetition and space collapse to ensure the diversity and completeness of large-scale data synthesis, successfully avoiding the drawbacks of previous methods.
